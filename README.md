# World Border
A Pocketmine plugin, allowing you to edit the limits of a world. Hence why it's called a world border.

## Why is this plugin useful?
We offer the many features that most world border plugins do not have, such as: 
- More options = more customization. 
- New setting names such as range, instead of other options that didn't quite fit the name.
- Teleportation feature; Allowing you to teleport to the safest location once you've reached the world borders. Other world border plugins simply don't have this feature.

## Is there more planned features?
Yes, we plan to expand it to the very top! In the upcoming versions. Things such as MultiWorld will be supported hopefully.
